# AnimeStream

## Features:
* Available Dub and Sub anime ita
* Using ![Anilist](https://github.com/anilist) API for images, descriptions and anime research

* Find movies (most of them are missing from the source)
## To do:
* Make available anime dubbed ita ( not every anime and every episode are dubbed )
* Add Https and secure connection with account authentication using database
* Add Netflix like anime advicing with categories ( Some Hanime are already available )
* Remove the different seasons from default view to prevent difficulties with scraping
* Add redundancies website with easy scraping
* Save urls to a database to prevent web scraping of already scraped anime
